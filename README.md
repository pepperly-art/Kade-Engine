## Friday Night Funkin' VS Piconjo!

> Uh oh! You and your girlfriend are trying to spam Teh Pr0tal with badly recorded Let's Plays and memes featuring you, but someone is standing in your way! Are you going to die? Or fall in love!?

**To anyone who wants to use my art / source for future Piconjo-themed mods:** Feel free and have fun! Just credit me (Pepperly) for the art! Please don't use my assets for profit, though. (also maybe @ me somewhere if you use them I wanna plaaay lmao)

**If you hate the special arrow animations** in Piconjo Never Dies, turn off Distractions OR remove the modchart.lua file within Assets/Data/Piconjo-Never-Dies

## Bugs
There are a couple small bugs I don't know how to iron out, came with KadeEngine, I think:
- Changing the song offset within Piconjo Never Dies causes an error / crash.
- Sometimes when loading the Customization screen, boyfriend refuses to load and will crash the game. Going into any song first and backing out tends to make it accessible again.
- Arrow trails are broken again/still.


## Kade Engine
**Kade Engine** is a mod for Friday Night Funkin', including a full engine rework, replays, and more.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.

# Features

 - **One goofy song**
     - It's Piconjo, what else would you expect. Also I don't know how to make music so this is all you get unless someone gives me more, lmao.
 - **TWO Piconjos**
     - We got the Chad, Real Piconjo, hotter than ever, but also the Virgin Mindchamber Piconjo for the people who prefer the greasy little gremlin seen in Newgrounds Rumble.
 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Editable Keys**
	 - Hey buddy, guess what, you can customize your keys. How awesome is that.
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended.
